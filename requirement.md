As an ordinary non techie person

I want to be able to log into an alexa skill

Using my voice while being observed in a public place

Easily, quickly and enjoyably

Without observers finding out my user credentials

Using only my voice

In a secure way

So enabling me to trust skill to make personal transactions

Such as paying for transactions using my store of cyptocurrency.
